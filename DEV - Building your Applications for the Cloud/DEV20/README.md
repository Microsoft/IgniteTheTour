# Deploying your application faster and safer

Application deployment has changed drastically over the years, with tedious, manual tasks being replaced by scripted routines. It’s even easier today with cloud services to help you out.

In this talk, we’ll take a deep dive into automating and continuously deploying your application using Azure Services. We’ll start with the basics, discussing automated operations that developers control (DevOps) like A/B testing and automated approval gates. We’ll then take that entirely to the cloud using Azure’s new DevOps project, showing you how you can automate the deployment of a frontend web application, backend web service and database, and mobile application with a few clicks of a button.
