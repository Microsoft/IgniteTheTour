## SRE30 - Diagnosing Failure in the Cloud

Tailwind Trader’s modern monitoring and alerting processes are working great. So great they have detected some issues with our application and how it is behaving in the cloud. It's time to make sense of what's going on and how to resolve trouble.
 
In this module, we will explore the processes and tools available to us to troubleshoot issues as they come up with running applications and infrastructure on Azure. Participants will gain exposure to querying log data found in Log Analytics as well as what to look for within Application Insights and Network Monitor to lead engineers to understanding and solving problems quickly.

# Services Used

- Azure Monitoring – Log Analytics, 
- Azure Monitor – Network Monitor, 
- Application Insights

## Setting up a demo environment

*In Azure CloudShell*

Note: the git commands below require some auth setup, see [Appendix A](#AppendixA) at the end of this document.

### Get the code

```
mkdir ~/source
pushd ~/source

# This repo has all the setup scripts for SRE30 and application code
git clone https://dev.azure.com/ignite-tour-lp5/SRE30-Setup/_git/SRE30-Setup

# This repo has the database schema scripts
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/tailwind-traders

```

### Set up the demo environment

By default, the scripts will set up a resource group named `SRE30-${CITY}-${APP_ENVIRONMENT}` so each person will have an individual standalone environment.

All of the naming parameters are defined in `./setup/0-params.sh`.

```
pushd ~/source/SRE30-Setup

# edit the parameters to meet your needs
code ./setup/0-params.sh

./setup.sh

popd  

```

Output from each of the commands in the scripts can be found in a corresponding log file in `./setup/log` (e.g. for ./2-database.sh there will be a ./2-database.log).

### Clean up

```
cd ~
source ~/source/SRE30-Setup/setup/0-params.sh
az group delete -n "${LEARNING_PATH}${SESSION_NUMBER}-app-${CITY}-prod" --yes --no-wait
az group delete -n "${LEARNING_PATH}${SESSION_NUMBER}-db-${CITY}-prod" --yes --no-wait

rm ~/source/SRE30-Setup/setup/.dbpass
rm -rf ~/source/tailwind-traders
rm -rf ~/source/SRE30-Setup
```

### Profit

### <a name="AppendixA"></a>Appendix A: git auth
During the period of time where the code for this demo env lives in private repos, there are two separate sets of git auth that have to be set up a single time:

1. auth for dev.azure.com: create alternative credentials.
This can be performed by going to the dev.azure.com page for the repos (https://dev.azure.com/ignite-tour-lp5/_git/SRE30-Setup), clicking on _Clone_, filling out the bottom half of the form and choosing "Save Git Credentials". 
For more information, [see the Azure DevOps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/auth-overview?WT.mc_id=msignitethetour-github-sre30&view=vsts). Your alternative credentials ($USER@microsoft.com and the password you supplied) will be used for the git clone prompts.
1. auth for github.com: create a personal access token by choosing Settings->Developer settings->personal access tokens from the drop down menu under your picture on github.com (when logged in). When you create a person access token,
be sure to choose the "\[ \] repo Full control of private repositories" scope box. Note: you must also be a member of the Azure-Samples Organization for the repo to be accessible.
For more infomation on personal auth tokens see https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/. Your github username and the personal access token you created will be used for the git clone prompts.
