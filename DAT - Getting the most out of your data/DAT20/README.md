DAT20 -  Dealing With Massive Data Ingestion 
Tailwind Traders deals with gigantic amounts of data, continually pouring in from:

	1. IoT delivery devices in our fulfillment centers 
	2. Point-of-sale orders from thousands of brick and mortar stores
	3. Online ecommerce orders from our web and mobile applications
	4. Telemetry data and application/system logs

All this data needs to be processed, churned, analyzed, and stored. In this talk we'll show you how Tailwind Traders has been able to answer analytical questions succinctly, such as "what products are generating the most sales?" and "which stores are generating the most revenue?" The effective analysis of information can make or break a company, and our partnership with Microsoft Azure has been instrumental in helping us look to the future, instead of react to the past.
